# Differential Privacy Improvements

## Summary

This issue covers improvements to the differential privacy pipeline used by Infinite Zero Network during local client training and update submission.

The DevNet baseline in [client.py](/home/azureuser/projects/devnet/cache_model_0/services/client.py) now supports three manifest-driven DP mechanisms:

- `post_training_gaussian`
- `post_training_laplace`
- `update_gaussian`

That is still a starter privacy layer rather than a production-ready one. The next step is to keep improving the privacy math, accounting, and service-generation workflow while preserving a clean manifest-driven developer experience.

## manifest

The model manifest at [manifest.json](/home/azureuser/projects/devnet/cache_model_0/manifest.json) can be used to define differential privacy parameters for a task.

That means DP behavior should not be limited to hardcoded values inside `client.py`. A model owner should be able to place DP-related settings in the manifest and let services read them at runtime.

Recommended manifest shape:

```json
{
  "dp": {
    "enabled": true,
    "mode": "afterTraining",
    "mechanism": "post_training_gaussian",
    "parameters": {
      "clipping_norm": 1.0,
      "noise_multiplier": 0.5,
      "laplace_scale": 0.35,
      "clip_scope": "per_layer"
    }
  }
}
```

The nested `dp` object is the current config surface for the DevNet client service.

These parameters can be accessed inside services through the injected service runtime context:

```python

# Example of how to resolve DP parameters in a service from manifest:

def train_client_model_and_upload_to_ipfs(
    genesis_model_ipfs_hash,
    account_address,
    effective_network="local",
    initial_model_ipfs_hash=None,
    model_base_dir="",
    gi=None,
    runtime=None,
):
    dp_config = resolve_dp_config(runtime=runtime)
```

For example, a client service can resolve manifest-driven DP settings from `runtime` instead of hardcoding them or reloading manifest state manually:

```python
if dp_config["enabled"] and dp_config["mode"] == "afterTraining":
    private_state_dict = apply_dp_mechanism(
        trained_state_dict,
        dp_config,
        reference_state_dict=reference_state_dict,
    )
```

This is why the runtime context was added: `dincli` resolves the manifest once for a service run, injects it into the service call, and lets service code read DP configuration through `runtime.get_manifest_key(...)`. That keeps privacy configuration in the manifest, makes service behavior easier to tune per model, and avoids coupling service code to CLI-side manifest lookup details.

## Implemented DevNet Baseline

Current behavior in [client.py](/home/azureuser/projects/devnet/cache_model_0/services/client.py):

- `post_training_gaussian`: clips the final model weights and adds Gaussian noise tensor-by-tensor.
- `post_training_laplace`: clips the final model weights and adds Laplace noise tensor-by-tensor.
- `update_gaussian`: computes the local update relative to the starting model, clips that update, adds Gaussian noise, and reconstructs a full private weight file so the existing aggregator contract does not change.

Supported parameters in the manifest today:

- `clipping_norm`
- `noise_multiplier`
- `laplace_scale`
- `clip_scope` with values `per_layer` or `global`

Compatibility notes:

- `dp.enabled: false` bypasses privacy and uploads the raw trained weights.
- if the `dp` block is absent, privacy is treated as disabled.
- `update_gaussian` uses the starting model for the round as its reference, which is the latest global model when one is available and the genesis model otherwise.

## Sources And Lineage

Current lineage for the DevNet client-side DP implementation:

- The shipped implementation in [client.py](/home/azureuser/projects/devnet/cache_model_0/services/client.py) was written directly for this repository and is the authoritative source for the current behavior.
- The manifest/runtime access pattern is based on the local `dincli` runtime context in [runtime.py](/home/azureuser/projects/devnet/dincli/services/runtime.py), not on an external DP library.
- The current mechanisms use plain PyTorch tensor operations and do not directly vendor code from an external privacy library or from the data-valuation repositories below.

Related research and repository references that informed the direction:

- Threshold KNN-Shapley paper: <https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15709>
- Local checkout of TKNN-Shapley: [README.md](/home/azureuser/projects/gitrepos/TKNN-Shapley/README.md)
- TKNN-Shapley privacy/accounting helpers: [helper_privacy.py](/home/azureuser/projects/gitrepos/TKNN-Shapley/helper_privacy.py) and [helper_knn.py](/home/azureuser/projects/gitrepos/TKNN-Shapley/helper_knn.py)
- Datascope repository: [README.md](/home/azureuser/projects/gitrepos/datascope/README.md) and upstream repo <https://github.com/easeml/datascope>
- Awesome Data Valuation list: [README.md](/home/azureuser/projects/gitrepos/awesome-data-valuation/README.md) and upstream repo <https://github.com/daviddao/awesome-data-valuation>

The important boundary is this:

- DevNet currently implements simple manifest-driven Gaussian/Laplace/update perturbation for local model submission.
- TKNN-Shapley and the related valuation repositories were used as reference material for future privacy-aware contributivity and scoring work, not as direct drop-in code for this service.

## Why This Matters

Differential privacy helps reduce the risk that sensitive information can be inferred from model updates shared during federated learning.

For Infinite Zero Network, this matters because the protocol is intended to support:

- decentralized training across many participants
- validator-coordinated aggregation
- auditable reward and evaluation workflows
- future secure aggregation and privacy-preserving infrastructure

If privacy is only applied in a simplistic way, contributors cannot reason clearly about the trade-off between privacy and model utility, and the wider system cannot build reliable guarantees on top of it.

This also matters because the intended developer workflow is modular: model owners should be able to assemble service artifacts with different privacy options instead of editing low-level training code by hand.

## Product Direction

`dincli` is expected to become a tool that helps model owners build the service artifacts used in a deployment, such as:

- `aggregator.py`
- `auditor.py`
- `client.py`
- `model.py`
- `modelowner.py`

The goal is a modular workflow where a model owner can choose implementation options and parameters, generate the final service artifacts, and place those artifacts into the deployment manifest.

Within that workflow, differential privacy should be treated as a selectable capability rather than a single hardcoded implementation.

## Current State

Current implementation lives primarily in:

- `cache_model_0/services/client.py`
- `cache_model_0/services/model.py`

Related integration points include:

- `dincli/`
- aggregation workflows
- auditor workflows
- model-owner service generation workflows

The current approach roughly does the following:

1. Train the local model.
2. Resolve DP settings from the manifest/runtime.
3. Apply the selected mechanism to either final weights or the local update.
4. Upload a private `state_dict` that remains compatible with the current aggregator.

Representative logic now looks like:

```python
dp_config = resolve_dp_config(runtime=runtime)

private_state_dict = apply_dp_mechanism(
    model_architecture.state_dict(),
    dp_config,
    reference_state_dict=reference_state_dict,
)
```

## Main Limitations

### 1. Privacy Is Applied Only After Training

The current mechanism perturbs weights after local training completes.

That is simple to implement, but it is weaker and less principled than approaches such as:

- DP-SGD
- per-step clipping
- per-sample gradient clipping

### 2. No Privacy Accounting

The system does not currently report:

- epsilon (`ε`)
- delta (`δ`)
- privacy budget consumption
- accountant outputs over time

Without this, privacy claims are not measurable.

### 3. Static Hyperparameters

Parameters such as `sigma = 0.5` and `S = 1.0` are effectively hardcoded in the implementation. Those values should be configurable through the model manifest, code, config, or CLI inputs.

### 4. No Strategy Selection For Model Owners

There is no clear mechanism for a model owner to choose among multiple differential privacy approaches when building a service package.

The product direction should support selecting between strategies such as:

- no differential privacy
- weight-level noise after training
- update-level privacy
- DP-SGD
- future custom privacy modules

That choice should be explicit in `dincli` and preserved in the generated artifacts or manifest configuration.

### 5. Weight-Level Perturbation

The current implementation modifies raw model weights directly rather than working with:

- gradients
- local deltas
- layer-level updates

That makes experimentation harder and weakens the connection to standard DP training practice.

### 6. Limited System Integration

The privacy logic is not yet designed to fit future workflows such as:

- secure aggregation
- subgroup aggregation
- encrypted or masked updates
- validator-side privacy-aware evaluation

## Scope Of Work

Contributors should aim to improve the privacy pipeline while keeping the implementation practical for the current DevNet codebase.

Useful directions include:

- defining a `dincli` interface for selecting DP mechanisms during service generation
- replacing or extending post-training noise with a more principled DP method
- reading DP parameters from the model manifest in client services
- making parameters configurable through `dincli` and config files
- making those selections visible in generated service artifacts and manifests
- adding privacy accounting outputs
- benchmarking privacy versus model utility
- documenting trade-offs and operational assumptions

## Expected User Workflow

The intended workflow for a model owner should look roughly like this:

1. Define the model and service requirements.
2. Choose whether differential privacy is enabled.
3. Select a DP mechanism.
4. Set mechanism-specific parameters in the manifest.
5. Generate service artifacts with `dincli`.
6. Reference the generated artifacts in the model-owner manifest.

The issue is not only about the privacy math. It is also about designing a clean developer experience for selecting, configuring, and materializing privacy behavior.

## DP Strategy Selection

`dincli` should eventually support multiple differential privacy modes that a model owner can select during service generation.

Possible examples:

- `none`
- `post_training_gaussian`
- `update_gaussian`
- `dp_sgd`

Each mode should define:

- where privacy is applied
- which parameters are required
- which optional parameters are available
- whether privacy accounting is supported
- whether the mode is compatible with future aggregation strategies

## Parameterization

The tool should make it clear how parameters are chosen and applied.

Examples of parameters that may vary by DP strategy include:

- `sigma` or `noise_multiplier`
- `clipping_norm`
- `delta`
- target `epsilon`
- accountant type
- per-layer versus global clipping
- update-level versus gradient-level privatization

Contributors should think about both:

- the user-facing configuration model
- the internal implementation path that maps those settings into generated code or runtime configuration

## Configuration And Artifact Generation

One acceptable direction is for `dincli` to generate service artifacts from modular templates or configuration-driven builders.

For example, a model owner might choose:

- a client training strategy
- a DP mechanism
- aggregation behavior
- auditor behavior

That selection should then influence generated files such as:

- `client.py`
- `aggregator.py`
- `auditor.py`
- `modelowner.py`

The exact implementation can vary, but the result should make it clear:

- which DP mechanism is active
- which parameters were selected
- where the mechanism is applied
- what assumptions the generated service makes

## Suggested Tasks

### Beginner Tasks

#### Configurable DP Parameters

Move hardcoded privacy parameters into configuration or CLI options.

Example:

```yaml
dp:
  enabled: true
  mechanism: post_training_gaussian
  sigma: 1.0
  clipping_norm: 1.0
```

#### Better Logging

Expose useful training and privacy metadata, for example:

- clipping norm
- noise multiplier
- DP mode
- training accuracy
- privacy accountant status

#### CLI Support

Add flags in `dincli` so model owners can select privacy settings without patching code.

Example:

```bash
dincli build service \
  --service client \
  --dp post_training_gaussian \
  --sigma 1.0 \
  --clip-norm 1.0
```

#### Per-Layer Clipping

Replace a single global clipping pass with per-layer clipping, or at least make the clipping strategy swappable.

#### DP Mechanism Selection

Design a CLI or config interface that allows model owners to choose one DP mode from multiple supported implementations.

The first version does not need every mechanism fully implemented, but it should establish a clean extension model.

### Intermediate Tasks

#### Privacy Accounting

Integrate an accountant and expose measurable privacy outputs.

Candidate options:

- Opacus accountant
- Renyi DP accountant
- moments accountant

Example output:

```text
Privacy Budget:
epsilon = 4.82
delta = 1e-5
```

#### DP-SGD Integration

Evaluate or integrate a more standard private optimization flow.

Candidate options:

- Opacus
- TensorFlow Privacy
- custom DP-SGD implementation

Example:

```python
from opacus import PrivacyEngine

privacy_engine = PrivacyEngine()

model, optimizer, data_loader = privacy_engine.make_private(
    module=model,
    optimizer=optimizer,
    data_loader=data_loader,
    noise_multiplier=1.1,
    max_grad_norm=1.0,
)
```

#### Update-Level Differential Privacy

Instead of perturbing full model weights, compute and privatize the client update itself.

Example:

```python
local_update = local_model - global_model
```

#### Service Builder Integration

Connect DP strategy selection to the modular service-generation workflow so generated artifacts consistently reflect the chosen privacy behavior.

This may involve:

- config schema design
- template selection
- builder logic in `dincli`
- manifest-facing metadata

### Advanced Tasks

#### Secure Aggregation Compatibility

Research and prototype approaches that remain compatible with decentralized aggregation, such as:

- additive masking
- Bonawitz-style secure aggregation
- MPC-friendly update handling

#### Homomorphic Encryption Exploration

Investigate whether future privacy layers could work alongside encrypted aggregation approaches, for example:

- CKKS
- TenSEAL

#### Byzantine-Resistant Aggregation

Explore robust aggregation methods that pair well with private updates, such as:

- Krum
- median aggregation
- trimmed mean

#### Privacy-Aware Reward Evaluation

Investigate whether privacy metadata can inform:

- auditor-side validation
- reward scoring
- contributivity analysis

## Expected Deliverables

Contributors may submit one or more of the following:

- code improvements
- tests
- benchmarking results
- research notes
- documentation updates
- example experiments
- service-generation design proposals

## Local Repo Scan Notes

Relevant material found in `/home/azureuser/projects/gitrepos`:

- [`TKNN-Shapley`](</home/azureuser/projects/gitrepos/TKNN-Shapley/README.md>) is the strongest local reference for privacy-aware data valuation. It includes:
  - private threshold KNN-Shapley
  - naively privatized KNN-Shapley
  - subsampled Gaussian mechanisms
  - RDP and PRV-based privacy accounting hooks in [`helper_knn.py`](</home/azureuser/projects/gitrepos/TKNN-Shapley/helper_knn.py>) and [`helper_privacy.py`](</home/azureuser/projects/gitrepos/TKNN-Shapley/helper_privacy.py>)
- [`datascope`](</home/azureuser/projects/gitrepos/datascope/README.md>) is useful for scalable data valuation and KNN-Shapley context, but it is not a direct DP implementation in the checked-in code.
- [`awesome-data-valuation`](</home/azureuser/projects/gitrepos/awesome-data-valuation/README.md>) is a curated research index that is helpful for contribution-scoring scenarios, especially where privacy, valuation, and federated workflows intersect.

Concrete scenarios worth exploring next for Infinite Zero Network:

- privacy-preserving contributivity scoring for local model submissions
- validator-side scoring that uses a DP-friendly KNN or TKNN-style valuation stage
- update subsampling plus privacy accounting for repeated rounds
- combining private updates with future secure aggregation or robust aggregation logic
