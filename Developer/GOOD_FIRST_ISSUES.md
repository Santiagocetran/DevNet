# Good First Issues

Welcome to InfiniteZero Network DevNet. This is a live, open experiment in building a global AI commons, and there's real work to do.

This document is your entry point for beginner-friendly contributions across federated learning, privacy-preserving systems, blockchain coordination, and developer tooling. Each detailed issue lives in `Developer/issues/`.

## What We're Building

InfiniteZero is a protocol for collective AI training. Participants run lightweight validator nodes that help train, aggregate, and validate models, while raw data never leaves the device. Built on Ethereum. Governed by the community. Models belong to the commons.

Core components:

- Public blockchain coordination
- Validator-based aggregation
- IPFS-based model exchange
- Privacy-preserving AI training
- Trustless auditing and evaluation
- Scalable subgroup aggregation

## Open Issues

### 1. Differential Privacy Improvements

**Difficulty:** Beginner → Intermediate  
**Area:** Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning  
**Detailed issue:** [issues/DifferentialPrivacy.md](issues/DifferentialPrivacy.md)

Improve the current differential privacy workflow used in local training and model update submission.

Current focus areas:

- stronger privacy mechanisms beyond simple post-training perturbation;
- configurable clipping and noise settings;
- privacy accounting and reporting;
- better integration with `dincli`, client services, auditor workflows, and aggregation flows;
- clearer design guidance on when different model types should use different privacy mechanisms.

Important framing:

- different kinds of models may need different privacy mechanisms;
- a simple post-training mechanism may be acceptable for a small MLP baseline, but it may be a poor fit for CNNs, transformer-style models, recommender systems, sequence models, or embedding-heavy pipelines;
- we do not want to assume one DP mechanism is correct for every task shape.

#### What We Need From Contributors Or Reviewers

- assess whether the current mechanisms are technically appropriate for the model and training setup;
- explain how effective the current mechanisms are likely to be in practice;
- analyze the utility versus privacy tradeoff for each mechanism;
- identify which parts are acceptable baselines and which parts are only temporary heuristics;
- recommend which model classes likely need different privacy mechanisms entirely.

#### Questions We Want Answered

- Is `post_training_gaussian` a defensible baseline here, or only a placeholder?
- Is `post_training_laplace` useful in practice for this workflow, or mostly experimental?
- Is `update_gaussian` materially better aligned with federated learning than weight-level perturbation in this codebase?
- Which model families should use different privacy mechanisms entirely?
- What should be measured to compare privacy effectiveness against model utility?
- Should this roadmap move toward DP-SGD, per-layer clipping, adaptive clipping, accountant integration, or something else first?
- What privacy claims should we avoid making with the current implementation?

#### What A Strong DP Review Should Include

- a critique of each implemented mechanism, not just a preferred replacement;
- explicit notes on which model and task types the current mechanisms fit or do not fit;
- utility-risk comments such as expected accuracy degradation, convergence issues, or update distortion;
- guidance on whether privacy should be applied to gradients, updates, weights, layers, logits, or scoring outputs for different scenarios;
- a prioritized recommendation list for implementation sequencing.

- `cache_model_0/services/aggregator.py`
