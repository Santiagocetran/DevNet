"""Client-side local training service for the DevNet reference model.

This module is loaded dynamically by `dincli` for the manifest entry
`train_client_model`. The function exposed at the bottom of
the file is responsible for:

1. Fetching the genesis or latest global model from mount
2. Loading the client dataset from the cache directory.
3. Training a local model for the current round.
4. Optionally applying a manifest-selected differential privacy mechanism.
5. Generate the local model

The DP helpers are deliberately kept framework-light and pure PyTorch so the
service can run without extra privacy libraries such as Opacus. The current
mechanisms are post-training mechanisms rather than full DP-SGD; that makes the
service easier to ship in DevNet, but it also means the privacy guarantees are
more limited than a production privacy stack.
